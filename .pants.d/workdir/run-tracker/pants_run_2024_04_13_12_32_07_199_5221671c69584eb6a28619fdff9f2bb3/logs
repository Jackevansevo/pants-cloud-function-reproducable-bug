InvalidLockfileError: You are consuming `flask-sqlalchemy`, `functions-framework`, and 3 other requirements from the `python-default` lockfile at 3rdparty/python/default.lock with incompatible inputs.



- The inputs use interpreter constraints (`CPython==3.11.*`) that are not a subset of those used to generate the lockfile (`CPython==3.12.2`).

- The input interpreter constraints are specified by your code, using the `[python].interpreter_constraints` option and the `interpreter_constraints` target field.

- To create a lockfile with new interpreter constraints, update the option `[python].resolves_to_interpreter_constraints`, and then generate the lockfile (see below).

See https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/docs/python/overview/interpreter-compatibility for details.

To regenerate your lockfile, run `pants generate-lockfiles --resolve=python-default`.

See https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/docs/python/overview/third-party-dependencies for details.
